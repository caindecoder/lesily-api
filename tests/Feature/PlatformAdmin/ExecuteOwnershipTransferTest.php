/**
 * SM-1-05 T4 — a platform admin executes a verified transfer, moving ownership
 * atomically (UC-1-093, slice #11 Task 8). One behavior, one seam, one actor, so
 * the illegal-transition refusals, the live re-validation guards and the happy
 * swap all live here, ordered Sad → Edge → Happy (§2.14 Rule A).
 *
 * The heaviest increment of the slice: five write surfaces commit together or
 * none do (SD-1-02 §2.2), across four $weight-ordered projectors.
 *
 * Two deliberate asymmetries with the siblings, both s159 rulings:
 * - Unlike reject (H4) and withdraw, a legal hold DOES refuse here (P5): §S10b
 *   freezes ownership CHANGES, and this is the one transition that changes one.
 * - Unlike every other transition, execute re-validates live state before the
 *   aggregate call (P3) — the owner and the target could both have moved since
 *   T1, and the aggregate never reads the database.
